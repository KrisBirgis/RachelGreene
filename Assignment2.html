            <h3>About the team</h3>
                <p>Founded in 1897 and listed on the Italian stock market, Juventus is a professional football club which, thanks to its more than century–long history, has become one of the most representative and popular team at a national and international level.</p>

            <h3>The 2020-2021 Season</h3>
                <p>The 2020–21 season was the 123rd season in the existence of Juventus and the club's 14th consecutive season in the top flight of Italian football. In addition to the domestic league, Juventus participated in this season's editions of the Coppa Italia, the Supercoppa Italiana, and the UEFA Champions League. The season covered the period from 1 September 2020 to 30 June 2021. On 25 November 2021, an eight-episode docu-series called All or Nothing: Juventus, which followed the club throughout the season, by spending time with the players behind the scenes both on and off the field, was released on Amazon Prime.</p>

        <h1>Teammate</h1>
            <h3>Zinadine Zidane</h3>
                <p>While the great Zizou left for Real Madrid in the summer of 2001 for a then-record €78 million, the impact he had on Juventus during his time in Turin was huge.
                    The beginning of the decade was the height of Zidane's reign as one of the best in the world. And it's no coincidence that this was the same period of when the Juventus were the toast of Italy.
                    It wasn't easy right off the bat for Zidane. It took him basically the entire season to get settled in and learn the ins and outs of Serie A.
                    From then on, it was full steam ahead. Zizou was a complete force. When it was clicking, seeing Zidane play was like watching poetry in motion. He was truly an artist creating a masterpiece on the field every time he was out there.</p>
