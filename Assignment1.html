        <h2>Land of the seals </h2>
        <h3>How to get there</h3>
            <p>Vatnsnes is a peninsula in North Iceland, best known for its wildlife and geology.

        <h1>Illugastaðir</h1>
        <h2>Where everything happens </h2>
        <h3>The story </h3>
            <p>Natan Ketilsson (1792 - 1828) was the original resident of Illugastaðir. On March 14th, 1828, Agnes Magnúsdóttir and her companion, Friðrik Sigurðsson, set about putting a wicked and preconceived plan into practice. Hoping to rob Natan of his livelihood, they murdered him and his shepherd, Pétur Jónsson, whilst the men slept in their beds. Hoping to hide all evidence of their crime, the pair set about burning down the house, alerting neighbours deceptively that Natan and Pétur were trapped inside. Once the fire was extinguished, townsfolk quickly discovered the bodies had multiple stab wounds between them. It wasn’t long until suspicion fell to the killers, as well as to Natan’s former grain girl (and Friðrik’s teenage lover) Sigríður Guðmundsdóttir.</p>

        <h1>Hvítserkur</h1>
        <h2>The basalt rock</h2>
        <h3>Where you can also find seals</h3>
            <p>Hvítserkur is a 15 m high basalt stack along the eastern shore of the Vatnsnes peninsula, in northwest Iceland. The rock has two holes at the base, which give it the appearance of a dragon who is drinking. The base of the stack has been reinforced with concrete to protect its foundations from the sea</p>
